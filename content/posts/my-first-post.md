This is my first blog post using hugo with `hyde-hyde` theme.

Let's go ahead and run the server and see how its all going to look like.

Let's try writing some code and see if this shows up correctly.

```python
import torch

X = torch.randn(3, 8, 112, 112)
# The dimensions of the tensor are 3 channels (RGB) with 8 temporal frames with 112 width x height. 

```
Oye! Oye! it works wonderful.
