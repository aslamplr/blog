I think I chose the name "Infinite Study" for the blog site. And I was so certain about the name at the time. But now, I am confused about the name? My area of interest is deep learning and I have chosen infinite study. Did I made a mistake of choosing **"study"** instead of **"learn"**? Ok let's go back to the meaning of these words and see.

## Study

*verb.*

- "devote time and attention to gaining knowledge of (an academic subject), especially by means of books."
- "look at closely in order to observe or read."

*noun.*

- "the devotion of time and attention to gaining knowledge of an academic subject, especially by means of books."
- "a detailed investigation and analysis of a subject or situation."

## Learn

*verb.*

- gain or acquire knowledge of or skill in (something) by study, experience, or being taught. commit to memory. become aware of (something) by information or from observation.
- teach (someone).

# What is the difference between *learn* and *study*? 
*taken from http://www.learnersdictionary.com/qa/How-to-Use-Learn-and-Study-*

The words learn and study are closely related to each other. Learn means "to gain knowledge or skill by studying" and study means "to read, memorize facts, attend school, etc."

When you study something, you have not learned it yet. When you are studying something, you are reading books or articles about something you do not know a lot about yet, or using flash cards to memorize facts, or listening to a teacher in a classroom, or watching videos about something so that you can know something or do something well.

When you learn something, you make it part of the things you know. When you know a lot about a subject, or are very skillful or knowledgeable about something, you have learned it.

Learning is gaining knowledge by studying, and studying is done to learn things.

**Relieved now!**
